10,Easy to use and I like that we are finally at this level with e-commerce. 
10,Easy to use. Happy that we are finally at this level with e-commerce. 
7,Harder to navigate to find the equipment unlike the old way. Probably will get used to it after awhile
10,The new website and app has made it easier for customers to navigate.
7,Because the site makes it appear that they can rent everything at every location. We have customers call everyday for items we don't have available in our district and it causes a bad customer experience. The site needs to be updated by location or at least mention in big bold type that not every location has every item on the website.

10,Anything to speed up the pace and make things run smoother . 
1,It is not user friendly. It does not work and the maps are not accurate. a lot of Equipment are still missing.  
8,I find the PC search more difficult and I can't seem to search Canada PC.  should be able to search in US or Canada
5,"I recommend it based on the ease of which you can pay and order online. The only bad thing is youre able to reserve machines we dont have. Were in Canada, Saskatchewan to be exact. We dont have the luxery of 8 stores within 100 km radius. We get customers mad at us they were able to reserve something that is 2 provinces over. "
3,
5,have gotten feedback that it is difficult to use 
3,"new website wont load half the time, reporting/ locations often crashes website. "
8,
1,
8,i am letting customers know about this app.
4,It has its upsides. But machine availability needs to be more branch specific. A customer should not be able to go online and reserve equipment we have no access to. Having to call after the fact to tell them we don't actually have the gear they requested feels unprofessional. 
6,

10,
1,The system is always slow can't log in can't make payments can't download invoices. 
10,easy to use
10,
4,if a customer is looking at the map for the closest store the distance is not accurate.  
10,"A lot of the features that were missing have been implemented, i.e. live cart, updated catalog, etc. "
0,"I have many customers that used the old system frequently. Though the new layout is more friendly, functionality has decreased drastically and we have received complaints that the website is to slow or will not access their information at all. My team and I have experienced this internally as well. we are unable to switch customers or enter service calls. "
7,It is a great tool for customers but after the updates it is very glitchy.
7,Needs improvement 
1,"I get complaints from customers who put in reservations online for equipment, only to find out the equipment they are ordering is not available. I had a customer the other day who was very upset asking why would the online portal allow this to happen & I was not able to provide her with an answer. that really affected their job & they also could not locate the equipment at any other rental companies & there was no equipment we could sub with. They needed what they ordered. This customer stated this is very poorly set up & needed to be improved upon. I also get a lot of call from other states that look online for equipment & they are working in another state & some how the website tells them to contact the Rockford Il branch when in reality they are working in IE..New York..I asked what they were doing to get the Rockford branch info, & they stated that when they were online looking for equipment to order off the website for a job, they stated that it asks for the jobsite Zip Code so it would display the branch closest to the jobsite & it selects our store. I get this often for New York, Had one the other day working in Texas that the website directed them to Rockford Il & then I have had Nevada & Minnesota. "
8,Ease of use and plethora of tools 
8,
8,
9,Easy to use
10,The Command Center & mobile app offer almost all levels of users ease of interaction/transaction and promotes self-serve functionality.
10,"Because these tools put our full service offerings at ours and our customer's fingertips. I do think we need more internal training on these though, only to be able to better demonstrate, sell, and utilize these tools to their fullest."
10,Is very simple to work with and user friendly
0,Previous version didn't require another account to be created with a separate application on the mobile phone.
10,The layout and functionality are better and I was already recommending the site to my customers before the improvements
1,because it does not work properly - customers are very frustrated - they can't get on it and when they do it just spins and spins.  The same when they go to make a payment.  the command center is a joke - it can take up to 5 minutes to process a payment. most of the time it just sits and spins and then kicks you out so you have to start all over.   very frustrating for everyone
8,It works much quicker 
6,SBU lags & hopefully SBR for customers does not
8,the content is improving 
10,Love the ease of the app
10,
10,"easy to print reports, pay invoices, review rental history"
8,"SBR has tons of information the customer needs, but it has some glitches."
9,"Ease of use for our customers, as they want access to fleet ASAP."
7,
3,The app is slow to use and the customers are having a hard time paying invoices and updating reservations/contracts for themselves. I have heard more complaints than good things about the app so far. The glitches are overbearing. 
1,Does not work on chrome unless in incognito mode.  Much slower than old site
7,Until you put an item in the cart it tells you every location has every tool in our inventory.
3,The new SBU platform is extremely hard to navigate 
10,
6,I have not used it myself in order to suggest using
2,Interface for SBU is confusing and buggy
10,
2,"because it is confusing. it will let you browse all of our inventory as aa company, instead of PC specific inventory. which in vey inconvienant when the closest PC is 45mins away"
10,Easy to use 
8,not user friendly
10,the accessibility and ease of SBR.com really helps an account manage and understand all of our options.
6,haven't had good luck with them on it
10,great app
4,
8,"Easy use, understandable, but may work better on different platforms"
10,
0,"I have to log in twice to even get into the website. It is extremely slow. There is nothing but problems, no receipts, cannot log in. Customers complaining it is not working. Unable to process payments, or pull invoices. etc. Have to re log in over and over and over again every day."
10,Ease of use.
10,
0,"The response time is terrible.  Takes forever to load invoices, switch to a different tab, run reports, etc.  Running payments takes forever and often times out.  The system logs you out but appears to still be in an account, so when you go back to it to do anything it just hangs.  You have to log out and back in to do anything, and then you go through the whole lag time issue all over again."
7,I honestly didn't see a whole lot of change.  Thought it was good before and not much different today.   
4,"The descriptions for power equipment are either lacking in crucial details such as voltage outputs on generators, or they provide conflicting information such as voltage on transformers. The details available on the equipment is not adequate to determine if the equipment will work for customer applications. "
3,Customers can overbook on any item anywhere and then get mad at the store when we don't have it or can't deliver in 1hr to a site 2 hrs away.
10,i review this site so it helps me find items in whynn .
2,"It allows customers to reserve equipment that is not at our PC, never has been. All equipment that a customer wants delivered, should always have to be ordered via a phone call to the office in order to gain all of the necessary contact information for drop off and to make sure we don't over promise our schedule. "
1,Because the Command Center does not work half the time and takes too long to process a payment. Customers are complaining. Most of the time you don't even get a receipt. This is making it very hard for the Credit Office to do our jobs.
5,"Application is very slow, loading of pages takes more than 2 minutes"
10,
3,IT IS EASY FOR CUSTOMERS BUT THE PC'S DO NOT GET THE EMAILS SINCE THE UPDATE TO BE ABLE TO NOTIFY THE CUSTOMER IF IT IS AVAILABLE AND THEY GET UPSET WHEN IT ALLOWS THEM TO RESERVE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT EVEN IN THE FLEET AT THAT PC 
5,
9,It is fairly streamlined and any bugs get fixed quickly. 
8,Seems easy to navigate.  User friendly.  
10,
0,I don't talk with clients. I won't have an opportunity to recommend it to them. 
10,it is great for the customers to use
10,"Huge asset to assisting customers with day to day needs and requests. Ultimately, freeing up much more time for daily requirements of my own schedule and keeps the customer fully engaged for a full circle experience. "
8,
8,easy to navigate but customers cant see inventory. 
10,so that customer's can manage their accounts independently 
8,its very easy and informative app to use.
1,The pricing isn't accurate and it doesn't do a good job of showing whats available in our district. it's also way more complicated to apply for a credit account than it used to be and because you set up a command center account in the same place as you apply for credit so a lot of people think they have credit accounts because they used the site when they dont have anything 
10,EASY TO USE AND LEARN THINGS ABOUT THE COMPANY.   
5,Chronos is rarely accurate. We get weborders for equipment we don't even carry. It would be nice if we could also search the website by cat/class
10,
2,The new website has been worse than the old. It's buggy. Frequently has issues loading and crashes. The reports don't generate easily - never had this problem in the old website. I don't need someone staring off the screen at me every time I open my account. Keep it simple.  
6,
1,"Rarely works. Crashes several times a day and can rarely even change to a different customer without having to shut down, wait for it to load, sign out and sign back in. Many customers still don't have proper access. "
5,It seems since the changes were made the website is moving much slower and there are a lot of loading issues.  Customers have been complaining a lot.  The new features are great but the functionality is spotty
3,"Since the update, using the customer command center section; it has been slower and more difficult to use. ""Sorry we got our wires crossed"" error pops up very often when using the iPad. "
10,"ease of use, up to date information, fast!"
8,
8,I like having the personal connection with our customers and don't want to send them off to the app.  
7,Some customers don't feel comfortable with electronics

1,"The Command Center is not functioning properly as it should. Payments sometimes do not go through and when they do go through they are not producing a receipt. Lately, the Command Center has not been working at all causing a decrease in revenue for the company due to the lack of being able to process payments. Customers are not happy about this. Wynne is slow and glitching out all the time. Cisco keeps kicking everyone off the phones constantly. The credit office team is not able to do their job effectively due to these concurrent issues. "
5,Credit Card process and system errors have made it difficult for our customers to make payments.

7,Great for account customers to place orders and call off equipment. Not a fan of the DIY (cash) orders as we have had a customer get upset at the fact that we're still required to verify the Card and ID of the rentee.
6,Shows entire company and not what we have for rent at our location. 
0,
0,"Command center is constantly down and the only fix we are given is to clear cookies/cache then hope it works. Customers are constantly complaining how long it takes to make a payment. Cisco goes down a lot. And not to mention the slightest nick in the system and Wynne goes down and takes 10-15 mins to reconnect. Our system seems like it is from an 80's DOS system. So to say the least, there are a ton of issues with our systems.    "
7,Because it's pretty good
10,
0,The program is very flawed. 
8,"The tool has benefits, but I wouldn't turn customers to use it for everything. "
3,"Since the change I have had to event several tickets in regards to customers being unable to pull reports, getting locked out of the system, and having issues with rates coming through.  Unfortunately, the customers do not see the change as an enhancement. "
9,The first thing on the site is an invitation to shop at Walmart.  That portion of Sunbelt is going away.
5,"Since the upgrade, I have gotten an error message during every single interaction on the site."
9,
10,Our customers have already started using our app! App is working! Keep it coming!!
3,"The new website is way worse than the old website. It's slow, laggy, and is rather difficult to find equipment because the keywords pull up different thing than the old website or omit searches completely. I think that the drop down menus got an improvement and I like the layout of it, but the menus are way too sensitive to where the mouse us"
0,Sometimes customers put orders for things we dont have in store. We try to contact them but sometimes there is no answer.   In one situation the customer had made payment but not made payment for freight and expected us to have a unit we never had rented before out of this store. 
7,
8,The customer is able to manage their account remotely with ease. One part that can be improved is adding quick tabs- an easy place for customer to access all quick functions immediately 
9,
10,The upgrades streamline the process for myself and our customers.

2,"I have been promoting and selling the new website and app to site Super, coordinators and PM's. Website is great, but I've lost some confidence in the App. I'm getting customers that say they try to off rent via the app and they get an error so they have to call me.  I've had another customer not be able to log on and have put him through to customer service a couple times. Once he had the new app installed he couldn't see the inventory on his job site.  Customer service said he had to call in himself and not me. After 3 tries he's getting frustrated with it as doesn't have time to call customer service again and deal with it.   Also, I have some questions about the app customers have given me. I called our IT help line and not able to help. I need to speak with someone who has helped develop this and is familiar with the mobile app. Thank you.  "
4,"works very slowly on payments, Credits cannot be applied.  Customers who want to use it get frustrated when they have to call to apply credits and when it is down for long periods of time"
7,The customers are complaining that they are constantly having trouble in the payment portion of the portal. 
3,very slow navigating from screen to screen very slow processing payments while on the phone with customers   
10,Ease of use
10,Easy 
10,
2,It is very unreliable with what it shows due and it is cumbersome to navigate
0,Page is too slow on my ipad. It take to much time to do anything on this app. Customer has many issues trying to using the page. 
7,"Customer's are able to reserve equipment that is not available locally.  Which unsure if this was meant, but leaves it to the PC to contact the customer to tell them we don't have it and break their heart with what freight charges are."
10,works great
10,
5,
8,Looks like something my customers could you. 
10,

5,I will give it to them however I hope it works. 
10,I believe in our digital direction
8,
9,"There should be a simple and short way of getting to the credit account sign-up page for customers.  Too many clicks to get there, can be confusing to customers "
9,The tachs were fast. Thank you 
10,
10,
9,
9,"its great so far, new look is nice. "
4,"We have had many issues with the website since it's launch, which I understand as ""growing pains"" for the website.  I am getting several customer complains that they are unable to access the website and unable to make payments."
7,some of the items the customer orders is not in our store or district but it lets them order it anyways
4,The website is creating a lot of customer dissatisfaction by guaranteeing availability that's almost always incorrect  
9,some people do not want  to use there phones to do business for reasons maybe they cant see it that or would rather just talk to a person. however id seem to be a lot easier for the ones that do like to use phones.
1,"Because Sunbelt focuses and invests in areas that they feel makes them look 'hi tech' or like a well oiled machine when the foundation is still extremely shaky. Today is just another typical day for me. I have FIVE customers that are unhappy with me.  1) Z-135 down for two days as parts are in order. Customer wants another unit. Lol 2) branch sends wrong size auger bit with skidsteer. Driver realizes it when he meets with customer. Now customer must wait >2 hours for both to be picked up down in Delaware  3) 3219 scissor rolls of truck and control box is bad.  4) customer places HUGE order 8 days ago. We wait until the last minute to look at the order and then we are short equipment on the order which she specifically said I need to know that you have this. Of course we didn't. Customer not happy at all 5)32RTS BOOTED off job as it had issues for first two days of rental.  6) unit scheduled for 7-73:0am delivery arrives at 10:30am and no one called the customer to give him a heads up I think we need to come up with a Sunbelt 4.0 text salesman when they lose money out of their pocket for their families Christmases, birthdays, vacations etc. when other departments do not perform to this so-called Sun Belt standard. Drivers, mechanics, managers, district managers, AR department i'll collect the same paycheck no matter what. But the salesman's pay depends on everybody in the entire lifecycle of the rental to perform. One link goes bad it comes directly out of his pocket if any other employee or dept falters. "
10,Easy to work with
9,It's always room for improvement
9,It's always room for improvement

8,The System can always be  improved. 
0,"I do encourage our team to send customers invitations to Command Center, we even recently had a contest to see who could sign up the most people. However the recent upgrades have made it much less user friendly and it seems to have a lot of issues with working correctly. There are so many filters and they do not make things easier for the customer.  The original more basic version was easier for navigation basic ease of use.  For our team there are issues moving from account to account that wastes an incredible amount of time.   I selected zero because of the issues but we do ask people to use it, in every demand and in our normal daily contacts with customers.  "
0,A lot issues and the system is down most of the time. 
8,I not set familiar with it
8,
7,
4,extremely slow -  
4,5
10,The new SBR.com is much easier to navigate. 
8,
1,The site is misleading. Customers are disappointed when notified that the equipment is unavailable in our state or region. The site allows customers to reserve and issue payment on equipment that is not in the rental fleet. It also allows to select units that are not available or have pending reservations. Customers are also unaware of the consumables and/or required items needed to utilize the equipment. Customers are not happy when informed of the additional cost.
3,
5,
10,"I think it's user friendly and convenient for our customers. However, I think the SB locations part of the website needs is cumbersome."
10,The ease of use 
6,"it's a great tool, but the tool doesn't work well. It still shows gear in our location that doesn't exist and many customers are frustrated with the miss information available."
10,Ease of use
10,Major upgrade from the old website. Way more user friendly
8,I've had great feedback from clients 
5,
6,
8,its a great tool and full of pertinent info 
10,"It has ben good, "
7,Some equipment does not pop up when you type it in the search bar on SBR.com. Example: typing Duct Jack into the search bar does not bring up all the different size Duct Jacks that we carry. 
3,"I have experienced several issues with the new website since the roll out.  I keep getting time out errors for reports, payment process is getting timed out.  I have Zachry Industrial personnel that have reached out to me expressing the same issues."
7,Some customer do not like using digital signature.
8,"Most of Temporary Structures customers are getting customized solutions, so it isn't really helpful for that.  I do recommend it for standard rental equipment."
10,"great tool for the team and customers to have, easy access to their accounts and everything the customer would use"
10,
10,"it's super easy to explain how to use, and navigate! "

6,You asked
10,It works.
10,
9,Ease of use 
3,"Too many issues with unavailability.   Customer can reserve anything regardless if it is a branch or not.   Lots of ""expectation""  issues with cash customers.  "
10,User Friendly 
4,"since the change of the website , I don't find it user friendly at all. The search bar doesn't pop up automatically. You have to know what ""class ""  to look under to find the item. If the customer or myself doesn't know what I am looking for that is what the search bar is needed for to look up an item. I find myself looking through google "" SUNBELT RENTALS and whatever else  I am looking for "" and then it'll take me to the website. "
0,It's always so slow and errors out frequently.
10,"GUI greatly improved, expanded functionality and better navigation."
5,Versus Command Center . Lost some key features for our customers to have  productive experience 
10,
10,gave a 10 because i still recommend to the customers even though after the recent update it has been lagging and not working correctly
6,The concept is great but the continued down time is a major issue
0,i would not give customer our tools. i have better results face to face
10,"While this is not a good site for scaffold users to rent, it is a great site for my customers to manager their accounts, see where gear it, update invoicing and have a fantastic insight into their accounts. "
5,"Tools/equip still missing from website, customers having difficulty creating accounts, customers having issues with command center info"
10,Easy to use
7,Hard to serve customers with a new app when our severely outdated computer system is still in effect. 
0,It is not accurate 
8,great re-design
8,I would like to see the banner pictures smaller - they take up too much room on the page.  
2,Almost every time I try and do something on it I get an error message ( our wires seem to have gotten crossed).  Too intermittent in easy function
5,
5,
8,"I forgot my password.  The ""Forgot Password"" email and txt was never received, did it several times, nothing.  Spent 50 minutes waiting on the phone for a digital customer care rep to pick up. Finally hung up.  Ill try again this afternoon.  "
2,"Because every time I have used the portal since it was relaunched it takes me numerous attempts to access the info that I am trying to look up. ""Sorry! Our wires are crossed""."

10,"It's an extremely useful extension of what sunbelt offers. Not only for customer use, but internal use as well."
5,Not enough experience to recommend one way or the other
9,At your fingertips info
7,not everything works as it should
5,
7,
9,Convenience
8,
9,Specs loaded for most equipment brands
8,
6,"The drop down menu for equipment types is overwhelming for a customer looking for a specific unit. I would recommend formatting in a way that you do not need to scroll to see all categories, personally. On first look, some categories seem to overlap, such as facility maintenance and cleaning, and surface preparation and floor care. For the heating section, I would copy the idea behind the generators dividing it by size, but would use ""home owner"" and ""industrial""."
10,"Wide selection, always available"
7,
10,super easy to navigate 
7,Website layout is great but it loads very slowly at times
8,Need to work with it a little more to become an expert to answer all their questions.
10,
9,
9,"Given the ease of account management, I regularly invite customers with inquiries about their contracts to visit the website and explore the tools available to track orders and payment status."
5,
10,
5,
10,I like the way the new format is user friendly. You can look equipment up on a PC as well as your phone quickly.
6,I think the system works well but it still has a lot of things to get to know
10,has value

0,
0,"most of our app based or website based stuff, does not work the way it should. It ends up being more work and difficult to navigate. Everything that gets released for online purposes is never ready. Make things 100% before you release them to employees and customers."
8,"Its a great tool and when appropriate , I'll recommend it. "
7,"I don't like customers ordering online,  half order wrong equipment for job at hand "
7,"Its a great tool and when appropriate , I'll recommend it. 8 because I feel that the site does NOT reflect accurately store specific inventory.  Creating a lees that positive first ""LIVE"" interaction with ERS on web reservations. "
8,"It is easier, however customer will still need guidance. "
8,
10,it is what we have to offer 
5,Having issues getting receipts back from customer payments and random CC surcharges... we need a way of retrieving receipts of payments
4,
8,Today's trend in business is eCommerce
5,
4,Ground Protection is not properly marketed on events side or heavy duty site access.
10,Support SB processes.
4,it gives you the entire sunbelt catalog vs the localized invitory for the store your setting up the reservation at 
4,there was no info given as to how to navigate the new system.

8,Very simple to use

0,Trench Safety / Shoring links have not been vetted by division staff at all.  I would be embarassed to have any customers visit the Shoring page / links.
0,"When I log in, it just doesn't work. Everything loads forever... half the time it times out. That's iPhone / Android / Chrome / Edge... I just cannot seem to log into my account, which makes it very tough to show customers, because I can't do my own walkthroughs and try things out for myself first."
